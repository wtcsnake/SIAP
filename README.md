# SIAP
An intelligent algorithm for multiple prescription pattern recognition based on weighted similarity distances.
It can automatically match sub-prescriptions of complex drugs with corresponding standard or classic prescriptions.

The main function is search_match(), it provide three sub-prescriptions recognition methods: 
1)	Intersection Set Rate (ISR);
2)	Subgroup Identification Algorithm for complex Prescriptions (SIAP)-ALL
3)	Subgroup Identification Algorithm for complex Prescriptions (SIAP)+ALL
